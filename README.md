solidity-patterns
=================
**solidity-patterns** is a repo for software design patterns for the [solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io) programming language.
The intent is to create as many applicable examples of common patterns, in hopes of promoting the language and improving it.
It is not the intent these contracts have any really useful applications on the [Ethererum](http://ethereum.org) network, but they should work if deployed.
